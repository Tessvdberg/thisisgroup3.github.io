<h5 >The next Paralympics are taking place in 2024 and Paris is going to be the host city. Part of the Paralympics is an open water swimming event and Amsterdam is considered as a host city for this event. This brief advises the municipality of Amsterdam on the feasibility of the event. It emphasizes four aspects of becoming a host city: Water, Energy, Housing, and Transportation. Below are key findings, as well as, more elaborate analyses for each domain. </h5>

  
<h2>Assignment 1 - Water</h2>
Since the Paralympic swim event is supposed to be hosted in open water, the water quality as well as the event's impact on the existing water traffic are crucial to take into consideration when organising the event. Below are the main conclusions that the municipality should stress on: 
<ul> 
<li>There is a lack of publicly available data concerning the water quality of Amsterdam’s canals and waterways. The municipality should put a greater emphasis on monitoring the pollution of its water. Besides, it should ensure that these data are accessible to every citizen. </li> 
<li>Bigger open waters such as the IJ are unsuitable for the swimming route since the current is too strong and boat traffic is too high. To be able to choose a suitable route, data on boat traffic from the ‘Digitale Gracht Amsterdam` project should be consulted.</li> 
<li>To be able to choose a suitable swimming route, more information is needed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignment 2 - Energy</h2>
The municipality’s goal is to host events that are fully green and only retrieve green energy. Therefore, it is crucial to look into the energy use of boats in general and the event’s support boats more particularly. The key findings of this theme can be found below: 
<ul>
<li>A transfer to energy-neutral vessels is likely to be most beneficial for canal and rental boats, since they are used very regularly and make up a great percentage of Amsterdam’s water traffic. Having more electric boat traffic on the Amsterdam canals can improve the water quality.</li>  
<li>The “Amsterdam City Swim” can function as a blueprint for the safety measures of the paralympic swim.  However, since the distance is longer, the quantity should at least be doubled. </li>  
<li>When hosting the event, it is beneficial to make use of spaces that have already existing energy points. That way the municipality can ensure that only green energy is consumed. Therefore, energy points should be taken into consideration when choosing a route.</li>

<h2>Assignment 3 - Housing</h2>
It is expected that 30 000 people visit Amsterdam to watch the Paralympic Swim event. These visitors need to be accommodated within the city. What does that entail for Amsterdam? These are the three main conclusions:
<ul>
<li>Due to the event, the municipality can receive a high amount of tourist taxes. Assuming that 30 000 tourists stay in an Airbnb, the tax can be up to 2 527 455, 00 €.  Consequently, the paralympic swim can have great economic value for the municipality.</li>
<li>Most Airbnb’s are located in Oud-West, Centrum West and De Pijp. This is especially important when thinking about mobility during the event week.</li>
<li>Due to several regulations, data on Airbnb apartments needs to be used carefully.</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Assignment 4 - Transport</h2>
Visitors that attend the Paralympic Swim event will be housed all over the city. Transportation is thus key in order to ensure a great experience for each visitor. Besides, a route needs to be chosen for the swimmers to follow. Here the following conclusions were drawn:
<ul>
<li>The swim route we suggest follows the Amsterdam City Swim route. It starts at the AMS and ends close to Frederiksplein.</li>
<li>Criteria for choosing this route were its accessibility for participants and the public, its impact on canal boat traffic, and the water pollution, which is expected to be low since it is monitored for the Amsterdam City Swim.</li>
<li>The starting point can be accessed through three buses and is 20 minutes walking distance away from the central station. The finishing point is located close to 4 tram lines as well as one bus. Based on the existing public transport infrastructure 740 people can be transported per hour to the starting point and 1957 people can be moved per hour at the ending point. Therefore, additional transportation modes will need to be offered.</li>
